Data available: Total Visits ( 2022 ), Weekly Media Spend, Events, CSI, CPI 
First I imported all the data into excel. Since 'Event' is a binary variable, we had to scale the other columns to make it consistent. This meant scaling the target variable as well. 
I then imported the scaled data into Python. 
Considered Event and Weekly Media Spend as my feature variables. Total Visits as Target. 
Used 2022 data:
Ran OLS using stats model and linear regression. 
R-squared of 0.049 in stats model
R-squared of -0.174 in sklearn. 

Using 2023 data, imputed values for total visits and ran regression again. 
R-squared of   0.029  in statsmodel 
R-squared of xyz in sklearn. 

Why smote wont work? There is no class imbalance! 

The problem with Cache creek is that we have insufficient/innacurate visits data. 
Non-scalable events columns. 
Slight correlation between weekly spend and visit data that we currently have... If data is innacurate, modelling will be poor. 


The relationship between media spend and total visits is not linear. We may need to explore polynomial features or other non-linear transformations. This is Adstock!

Include Interaction terms in the model. 

Outliers: Check for outliers

Model Evaluation: MSE or MAE

Possible that a non-linear regression may exist? Very possible
